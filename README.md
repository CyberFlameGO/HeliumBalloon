# HeliumBalloon

## Introduction
The "Fallong Blocks" are a native part of minecraft. They looks like a solid block, but can pass through most entities without colliding. Their position is not limit to block boundaries. Normally a Falling Block is the entity form of block that appears when a gravity-affected block loses its support. But you can make other funny stuff with them, e.g. let them fly around or simulate a solid but passable wall. This plugin uses Falling Blocks for some powerfull effects.

## Features
1. Build balloons and let them follow the player like a pet (with rope). You can also combine them with other living entities to build e.g. a caged illager following you.
2. Build hidden pathways by placing Faling Blocks at a fixed position to simulate a solid wall.
3. Permission-System to specity which pet balloon a player is allowed to use.
4. GUI (Graphical User Interface) to let the player select his pet.
5. Pet assignments are saved across sessions.
7. Extrem stable because a lot of checks are implemented to make the balloons reliable.
6. Multiworld support by using Regex for the worldname.
8. Powerfoll API to control almost everything with function calls.
9. Multi-Language support.
10. This plugin does not use NMS or ProtocolLib, only plain Spigot API. So it is very compatible across minecraft versions.

## First Steps
For a quick test do the following:
1. Login as a player with OP permissions
2. Enter "/balloon gui"
3. Select a pet

As a result you see a balloon following your player.
